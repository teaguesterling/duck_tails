# Duck Tails ü¶Ü

**Smart Development Intelligence for DuckDB**

Duck Tails is a DuckDB extension that brings git-aware data analysis capabilities to your database. Query your git history, access files at any revision, and perform version-aware data analysis - all with SQL.

**Status: ‚úÖ Phase 1-3 Complete** - Production ready with comprehensive test coverage and intelligent diff capabilities!

## ‚ú® Features (Phases 1-3 - Complete)

### üóÇÔ∏è Git Filesystem
Access any file in your git repository at any commit, branch, or tag using the `git://` protocol:

```sql
-- Read a CSV file from the current HEAD
SELECT * FROM read_csv('git://data/sales.csv@HEAD');

-- Compare data between commits
SELECT * FROM read_csv('git://data/sales.csv@HEAD~1');

-- Access files from a specific branch
SELECT * FROM read_csv('git://config.json@feature-branch');

-- Load data from a tagged release
SELECT * FROM read_csv('git://metrics.csv@v1.0.0');
```

### üìä Git Table Functions
Query your git repository metadata directly with clean, simple syntax:

```sql
-- View commit history (defaults to current directory)
SELECT commit_hash, author_name, message, author_date 
FROM git_log();

-- List all branches
SELECT branch_name, commit_hash, is_current 
FROM git_branches();

-- Show all tags
SELECT tag_name, commit_hash, tagger_date 
FROM git_tags();

-- Or specify a different repository path
SELECT * FROM git_log('/path/to/repo');
```

### üîÑ Version-Aware Analysis
Perform sophisticated version comparisons and historical analysis:

```sql
-- Compare record counts across versions
WITH current AS (SELECT COUNT(*) as cnt FROM read_csv('git://data.csv@HEAD')),
     previous AS (SELECT COUNT(*) as cnt FROM read_csv('git://data.csv@HEAD~1'))
SELECT current.cnt - previous.cnt AS records_added
FROM current, previous;

-- Analyze changes over time
SELECT 
    c.commit_hash,
    c.author_date,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM read_csv('git://metrics.csv@' || c.commit_hash)) as metric_count
FROM git_log() c
WHERE c.author_date > '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY c.author_date;
```

### üß† Intelligent Diff Analysis (Phase 2-3)
Smart text diffing capabilities with real file integration:

```sql
-- Pure text diffing (string result)
SELECT diff_text('Hello World', 'Hello DuckDB');

-- Text diffing (original function name)
SELECT text_diff('Hello World', 'Hello DuckDB');

-- Single file diff against HEAD (convenient shorthand)
SELECT * FROM read_git_diff('file.txt');

-- File-based diffing with local files
SELECT * FROM read_git_diff('file1.txt', 'file2.txt');

-- Git repository file diffing
SELECT * FROM read_git_diff('git://README.md@HEAD', 'git://README.md@HEAD~1');

-- Mixed file system scenarios
SELECT * FROM read_git_diff('local.txt', 'git://file@HEAD');

-- Structured diff analysis
SELECT * FROM text_diff_lines(diff_text('old content', 'new content'));

-- Diff statistics and metrics
SELECT * FROM text_diff_stats('old content', 'new content');
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- DuckDB v1.3.2+
- vcpkg package manager
- libgit2 (automatically installed via vcpkg)

### Building
```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/teaguesterling/duck_tails.git
cd duck_tails
make

# Run tests to verify everything works
make test

# Load the extension
./build/release/duckdb -c "LOAD 'duck_tails';"
```

### Basic Usage
```sql
-- Load the extension
LOAD 'duck_tails';

-- Query git history (clean syntax - no arguments needed!)
SELECT * FROM git_log() LIMIT 5;

-- Access version-controlled data
SELECT * FROM read_csv('git://test/data/sales.csv@HEAD');
```

### Testing
Duck Tails includes a comprehensive test suite with **82 test assertions** covering all functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Expected output: All tests passed (82 assertions in 4 test cases)
```

## üìã Examples

### Historical Data Analysis
```sql
-- Compare sales data between releases
SELECT 
    'v1.0' as version,
    SUM(amount) as total_sales
FROM read_csv('git://sales.csv@v1.0')
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'v2.0' as version,
    SUM(amount) as total_sales  
FROM read_csv('git://sales.csv@v2.0');
```

### Repository Analytics
```sql
-- Most active contributors
SELECT 
    author_name,
    COUNT(*) as commit_count,
    MIN(author_date) as first_commit,
    MAX(author_date) as latest_commit
FROM git_log()
GROUP BY author_name
ORDER BY commit_count DESC;
```

### Configuration Drift Detection
```sql
-- Compare configuration files across branches
SELECT 
    'main' as branch,
    * 
FROM read_json('git://config.json@main')
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'develop' as branch,
    *
FROM read_json('git://config.json@develop');
```

### Code Change Analysis
```sql
-- Analyze file changes between versions
SELECT 
    diff_text,
    length(diff_text) as diff_size
FROM read_git_diff('git://src/main.py@HEAD~1', 'git://src/main.py@HEAD');

-- Track configuration changes over time
SELECT 
    g.commit_hash,
    g.author_date,
    g.message,
    r.diff_text
FROM git_log() g
CROSS JOIN read_git_diff('git://config.json@' || g.commit_hash || '~1', 
                        'git://config.json@' || g.commit_hash) r
WHERE length(r.diff_text) > 0  -- Only commits that changed config
LIMIT 10;
```

### Advanced Use Cases
```sql
-- Find commits that introduced large changes
SELECT 
    g.commit_hash, 
    g.message,
    length(r.diff_text) as change_size
FROM git_log() g
CROSS JOIN read_git_diff('git://src/@' || g.commit_hash || '~1', 
                        'git://src/@' || g.commit_hash) r
WHERE length(r.diff_text) > 1000
ORDER BY change_size DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Compare data schema evolution
SELECT 
    'v1.0' as version,
    column_name,
    column_type  
FROM describe(SELECT * FROM read_csv('git://data.csv@v1.0') LIMIT 0)
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'v2.0' as version,
    column_name,
    column_type
FROM describe(SELECT * FROM read_csv('git://data.csv@v2.0') LIMIT 0);
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Duck Tails implements a custom DuckDB FileSystem that intercepts `git://` URLs and translates them into libgit2 operations:

- **GitFileSystem**: Handles git:// protocol registration and file access
- **GitFileHandle**: Memory-backed file handles for git blob content with seek operations
- **GitPath**: Parser for git://path@revision syntax supporting branches, tags, and commit hashes
- **Git Table Functions**: Direct repository metadata access with full commit history
- **TextDiff Engine**: Advanced line-by-line diff computation with multiple output formats
- **Real File Integration**: Seamless access to local files, git:// files, and mixed scenarios
- **vcpkg Integration**: Robust dependency management for cross-platform libgit2 builds

### Key Technical Features
- **Memory Efficient**: Files loaded on-demand into memory for fast access
- **Seek Support**: Full random access within git blob content
- **RAII Design**: Smart pointer usage throughout for memory safety
- **Error Resilient**: Comprehensive error handling for missing repos/revisions
- **Mixed File Systems**: Support for local + git://, S3 + git://, and other combinations
- **Zero-Argument Functions**: Clean syntax defaulting to current directory
- **Test Coverage**: 82 test assertions ensuring production readiness
